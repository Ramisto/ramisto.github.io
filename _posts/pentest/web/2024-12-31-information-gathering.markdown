# Information Gathering

If you want to rob a bank, are you going to rush in head first without any information and without preparation? What would be your chances of succeeding in the robbery?

It is the same for the information gathering, this step is the most important in the context of a penetration test, it will determine your ability to find security weaknesses in the next phases of the test.

To put it simply, the more relevant information you find during this phase, the greater your chances of finding security weaknesses, so do not hesitate to take your time to accomplish this task.

## Objectives

- Enumerate the applications within the scope that exist on a web server.
- Determine the version frameworks and type of a running web server.
- Identify hidden or obfuscated paths and functionality through the analysis of metadata files.

## How to test ?

### A. Enumerate applications on WebServer

```
nmap –Pn –sT –sV –p0-65535 <IP> # non-standard ports 
python sublist3r.py -d example.com # other subdomains
ffuf -w /path/to/dico -u https://www.example.com/FFUF # different base url
```

### B. Determine version frameworks and type of web server

Use curl :

```
curl -I https://www.example.com
```

Send malformed request with Burp Suite repeater :

```
GET / SANTA CLAUS/1.1
```

Use Wappalyzer browser extension for identify frameworks version.

### C. Identify hidden or obfuscated paths

Use curl for rewiew metafiles :

```
curl https://www.example.com/robots.txt
curl https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
curl https://www.example.com/.well-known/security.txt
curl https://www.example.com/humans.txt
```
